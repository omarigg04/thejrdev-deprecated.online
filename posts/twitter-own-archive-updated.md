Due to the "recent" [acquisition of Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk) and all changes that came after that, lots of users started considering other alternatives such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) and many others...

But what happens to the generated data over the years we have been making in this platform, what do we make with them? Discarding them? My thoughts on this are... why not just keeping it safe for the future?

In this case it is where **[Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) come into action**. An awesome project by [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) to take ownership of your Twitter data in a public archive you can self-host (for example in GitHub).

## Overview

Thanks to [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) and its awesome project [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback), we can self host our own Twitter archive and keeping it up-to-date if necessary ([just like I have done with mine](https://tweets.piraces.dev/)).

The process to make your own archive is simple. Just follow the steps below.

### Getting your Twitter archive in first place

This part is important to initialize our archive.
Twitter allows you to export a backup of all of your data you have in this platform. 

As they explain [in their help center](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/accessing-your-twitter-data), log in into your Twitter account (Web client) and:
1. Click More in the main navigation menu to the left of your timeline.
2. Select Settings and privacy.
3. Select "Your Account" under Settings.
4. Click on "Download an archive of your data".

<div align="center">

![Page where the data can be claimed](../../img/posts/twitter-own-archive-updated/twitter_archive_1.png)

</div>
<div align="center"><em>Page where the data can be claimed</em></div>

After clicking there, click in the button that says to request your archive. Then it will change the status to "Requesting archive".

<div align="center">

![Twitter settings page after requesting your archive](../../img/posts/twitter-own-archive-updated/twitter_archive_2.png)

</div>
<div align="center"><em>Twitter settings page after requesting your archive</em></div>

After taking this action, Twitter will collect your data and send you an email with a link to a `.zip` file with all your exported data. This process, can take up to 48 hours... so let's relax and keep with the process.
 
_**Note:** don't forget to download the `.zip` file as soon as you receive the email and save it somewhere (as the links expires shortly)._

### Getting the [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) code and setting it up

In my case [I just forked the repository](https://github.com/piraces/twitter_archive) but you can clone it and upload it to other site if you want.

Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (and Git of course).

Then follow this steps:

1. Clone the repo (or your fork):
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback.git
    ```

    _**Note:** if you choose creating a fork, the process of updating the repository for possible future changes from the base repository its easier with [the "sync fork" option that GitHub provides](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)._

2. Enter to the repository main folder with the terminal and perform a `npm install` (this will generate a `package-lock.json` file you will keep).

3. Following [the instructions of Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback#usage), open the zip file you downloaded from Twitter, and extract the `data/tweets.js` file from it into the `database` folder in your Tweetback repository folder.

4. Edit this file to change the first line `window.YTD.tweet.part0` to `module.exports` (a simple replace) so the first part of the file will look as follows:
    ```js
    module.exports = [
    {
        "tweet" : {
    ...
    ```

5. On the root folder of the repository run with the terminal the command `npm run import` which will perform the first initialization of our tweets database (going through the `tweets.js` file).

    _**Note:** if you have lots of tweets, the process can take a while..._

6. At the end, you will see some output regarding counts and other info (but no errors).

7. After importing the tweets, we will be making some changes to the `_data/metadata.js` file, which will customize some page settings for our archive. We will modify the options as follows (leave the others without modifications):
    - `username`: your twitter handle **without the `@` symbol**
    - `homeLabel`: the label that will appear at the top of your twitter archive... it will be a link to your home page, so call it accordingly.
    - `homeURL`: URL to your home page in absolute format (for example "https://piraces.dev").

<div align="center">

![Metadata settings and where they reflect the changes](../../img/posts/twitter-own-archive-updated/twitter_archive_2.png)

</div>
<div align="center"><em>Metadata settings and where they reflect the changes</em></div>

8. Now we are ready with our archive! Take a look at how it will be by running `npm run start` at the root folder and accessing the local URL that the process outputs to the terminal.

9. If everything looks good for you, commit and push your changes to the repository.

### (Optional) Set the subpath where your page will reside

You can skip this step if your twitter archive will be in the root of a domain/subdomain (such as [tweets.piraces.dev](https://tweets.piraces.dev/)), otherwise we will have to set the subpath where it will be served (for example if hosting in GitHub pages such as `piraces.github.io/tweets`).

To do this, we will need to do some changes to the `eleventy.config.js` file as follows (at the end before the closing `}`):
```js
...
    eleventyConfig.addPlugin(EleventyHtmlBasePlugin);
    return {pathPrefix: "/twitter/"}
};
```

_**Note:** change the `pathPrefix` accordingly to the path you want._

### (Optional) Configuring a subdomain to point to our GitHub Pages deployment

In this tutorial we will be using GitHub Pages to host our twitter archive, so since in my case I have the domain `piraces.dev` managed by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), I will create a subdomain called `tweets.piraces.dev` to point to the GitHub pages deployment.

To do this we will only have to create a `CNAME` DNS record with the value of the subdomain (`tweets` in this case) pointing to your GitHub domain that will be in the format `{{GITHUB_HANDLE}}.github.io` where `{{GITHUB_HANDLE}}` will be your handle/username in GitHub (`piraces.github.io` in my case).

<div align="center">

![CNAME DNS record pointing to GitHub pages](../../img/posts/twitter-own-archive-updated/cname_record_github.png)

</div>
<div align="center"><em>CNAME DNS record pointing to GitHub pages</em></div>

The picture above shows how to set it for Cloudflare, but it will be very similar in other providers.

### Deploying our archive using GitHub pages

Once our repo has all the changes mentioned above, we will have to configure GitHub pages for our repository.
To do so, we must follow this steps:

1. Create an empty branch named `gh-pages` (where the deployed page will be). From your terminal:

    ```sh
    git switch --orphan gh-pages
    git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit on orphan branch"
    git push -u origin gh-pages
    ```

2. Go to the repository page in GitHub and click "Settings" and there "Pages" from the left toolbar.

3. In the "Pages" screen, we will be setting the options as follows:
    - Source: select "Deploy from a branch"
    - Branch: select the `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` as base folder. Then click "Save".
    - Custom domain: only if you have set a custom domain from the previous optional step. Enter the custom domain, click save and wait for GitHub to perform the DNS checks. Once GitHub finish the DNS checks, click on the "Enforce HTTPS" option.

</div>
<div align="center"><em>GitHub pages settings example</em></div>

4. Setup a workflow to publish the page on every push to main branch or manually. To do so, we must go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository page, and then select "New workflow". From this page, we select "Skip this and set up a workflow yourself ->", then a editor appears and we can setup the workflow. You can use the following code (adapting some fields) to complete yours:

    ```yaml
    name: Publish page

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ "main" ] # Change this to the name of the main branch of your repository
      workflow_dispatch: # Setting this enables the possibility to run the workflow manually

    jobs:
      build:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Use Node.js 18.x
            uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
                node-version: 18.x
          - run: npm ci # Note that you must commit the package-lock.json to the repo and quit it from the .gitignore file
          - run: npm run build
          - name: Deploy to Github Pages
            uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v3
            with:
              # Build directory to deploy
              build_dir: _site
              # Write the given domain name to the CNAME file
              fqdn: tweets.piraces.dev # Change this to your configured subdomain or completely delete the line if not using it.
              jekyll: false
              keep_history: true # If you don't want to preserve a commit history, set to false to perform a git push --force
            env:
                GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN  }} # This secret is available by default
    ```

5. When finishing editing, click on "Start commit" and commit the workflow to the main branch. The workflow will start running after the commit, you can check the status from the "Actions tab" in the GitHub repository page.

6. If the workflow shows green (all steps are OK), go and check your URL and see your Twitter archive 🎉 (note, if something goes wrong with your configured subdomain, please revisit step 3).


### (Optional) Setting an scheduled action to update our archive

If you may still using Twitter in the future, consider modifying the workflow created in the previous step to fetch all new tweets using the Twitter API.

To do so, you will need a Twitter bearer token. You will only be allowed to obtain a Twitter bearer token if you are a "Twitter developer" 😢, so you will have to fill some forms and apply to become one.

To start the process to become a "Twitter developer" visit [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/), sign-in and start the process... It may be an annoying process with manually reviews.

Once you are a "Twitter developer", proceed to create an app and then getting its bearer token. Documentation about getting the bearer token can be found in the [official developer documentation of Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens).

When you have everything set-up correctly, copy the bearer token that will look like something like `AAAA...` (like random characters). Now go to the repository with your terminal and try to perform the update process for yourself locally (before modifying the remote workflow) to make sure everything goes smoothly.

When you are in the repository base path with your terminal, run the following command (where `AAAAAA...` is your actual complete bearer token):
```sh
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=AAAAAA... npm run fetch-new-data
```

This will fetch any tweets that are not in the database because you made them later.
After fetching new tweets, you will need to rebuild your site with:
```sh
npm run build
```

Take a look to the updated archive by running it locally with `npm run start` and accessing the URL that the process outputs to the terminal.
If everything looks OK to you, we are ready to modify our GitHub workflow to automate this!
Follow then this steps:

1. Go to your repository GitHub page, select the "Actions" tab, select your workflow in the left navbar, locate the latest execution of the workflow and click on "View workflow file". After this, select the edit icon and start modifying your workflow.

    _**Note:** you can also modify the workflow in your local environment accessing the folder `.github/workflows/` and editing the workflow._

2. We will be adding a new step after `- run: npm ci` to run the fetching process of new tweets. To do so, first you may need to add the Twitter bearer token as a secret to your actions (since you don't want it to be publicly visible). If you don't know how to do so, please follow the steps in [the GitHub official documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

3. After declaring the secret, add a step after `- run: npm ci` like the following (assuming your secret is named `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`, if not, change it accordingly):
    ```yaml
    ...
    - run: npm run fetch-new-data
      env:
        TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN }} # Change the secret name if different
    ```

4. In order to do this periodically, I decided to make my workflow run every night. To do so, you will only have to add a `schedule` entry in the `on` entry with a [cron rule](https://crontab.guru/) (adjust it if you want to your requirements):
    ```yaml
    name: Publish page

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ "main" ] # Change this to the name of the main branch of your repository
      schedule:
        - cron: "30 0 * * *" # This will trigger the workflow every day at 00:30 UTC
      workflow_dispatch: # Setting this enables the possibility to run the workflow manually
    ```

5. Your workflow now will look like this (with minimal differences):
    ```yaml
    name: Fetch new data & publish page

    on:
      push:
          branches: [ "main" ]
      schedule:
          - cron: "30 0 * * *"
      workflow_dispatch:

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Use Node.js 18.x
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
              node-version: 18.x
        - run: npm ci
        - run: npm run fetch-new-data
          env:
            TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN }} # Here the secret TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN
        - run: npm run build
        - name: Deploy to Github Pages
          uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v3
          with:
            # Build directory to deploy
            build_dir: _site
            # Write the given domain name to the CNAME file
            fqdn: tweets.piraces.dev
            jekyll: false
            keep_history: true
          env:
            GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Here the secret GITHUB_TOKEN
    ``` 

6. Save your workflow, commit and push it.

7. Checkout the execution process in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository to check everything goes OK.

8. You have now an "always updated" Twitter archive to be there for you and the people that may want to check it completely unattended! 🚀

    _**Note:** if you have any doubts regarding code/workflows you can always check my Twitter archive implementation: [GitHub - piraces/twitter_archive](https://github.com/piraces/twitter_archive/)._


### (Optional) Adding your archive to [tweetback-canonical](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback-canonical) (list of hosted Twitter backups)

[tweetback-canonical](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback-canonical) is a package to resolve twitter URLs to new canonically hosted twitter backups, 
made by [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) too.

Simple follow the process in their [README.md](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback-canonical#add-your-own-twitter-archive) to add the URL of your Twitter
archive to the `mapping.js` file.

The process its very simple:

1. Create a fork of the [tweetback-canonical](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback-canonical) repository.
2. Modify the `mapping.js` file adding your Twitter archive public URL to the end of the object, in the format:
    ```json
    "TWITTER_HANDLE": "FULL_URL_TO_TWITTER_ARCHIVE",
    ```

    _**Note:** your twitter handle must go without the `@` symbol and you must end the line with a comma._

3. Commit and push your changes with a commit message with starts with `mapping:`.
4. Open a PR to the main branch of the official repository and wait for approval and merge.
5. You are done with all! Congrats! 🎉


## Conclusion

We have seen in detail how to use the awesome [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) project to build and self-host our own Twitter archive/backup. Whether you may, or may not, want to get off Twitter, I think it's a great approach to get the ownership of your data anyways.

Doing this you are not exposed to lose the investment you put in generating those tweets if something bad happens (hopefully not 🙏).

Don't forget to report [any issues you find to the official repository](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback/issues) and thanks the author ([Zach](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat)) for the awesome work!

**Happy deploy!** 🎉🎉
