Due to the "recent" [adquisition of Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk) and all changes that came after that, lots of users started considering other alternatives such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) and many others...

But what happens to the generated data over the years we have been making in this platform, what do we make with them? Discarding them? My thoughts on this are... why not just keeping it safe for the future?

In this case it is where **[Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) come into action**. An awesome project by [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) to take ownership of your Twitter data in a public archive you can self-host (for example in GitHub).

## Overview

Thanks to [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) and its awesome project [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback), we can self host our own Twitter archive and keeping it up-to-date if neccessary ([just like I have done with mine](https://tweets.piraces.dev/)).

The process to make your own archive is simple. Just follow the steps below.

## Getting your Twitter archive in first place

This part is important to initialize our archive.
Twitter allows you to export a backup of all of your data you have in this platform. 

As they explain [in their help center](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/accessing-your-twitter-data), log in into your Twitter account (Web client) and:
1. Click More in the main navigation menu to the left of your timeline.
2. Select Settings and privacy.
3. Select "Your Account" under Settings.
4. Click on "Download an archive of your data".

</div>
<div align="center"><em>Page where the data can be claimed</em></div>

After clicking there, click in the button that says to request your archive. Then it will change the status to "Requesting archive".

After taking this action, Twitter will collect your data and send you an email with a link to a `.zip` file with all your exported data. This process, can take up to 48 hours... so let's relax and keep with the process.
 
_**Note:** don't forget to download the `.zip` file as soon as you receive the email and save it somewhere (as the links expires shortly)._

## Getting the [Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) code and setting it up

In my case [I just forked the repository](https://github.com/piraces/twitter_archive) but you can clone it and upload it to other site if you want.

Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (and Git of course).

Then follow this steps:

1. Clone the repo (or your fork):
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback.git
    ```

2. Enter to the repository main folder with the terminal and perform a `npm install` (this will generate a `package-lock.json` file you will keep).

3. Following [the instructions of Tweetback](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback#usage), open the zip file you downloaded from Twitter, and extract the `data/tweets.js` file from it into the `database` folder in your Tweetback repository folder.

4. Edit this file to change the first line `window.YTD.tweet.part0` to `module.exports` (a simple replace) so the first part of the file will look as follows:
    ```js
    module.exports = [
    {
        "tweet" : {
    ...
    ```

5. On the root folder of the repository run with the terminal the command `npm run import` which will perform the first initialization of our tweets database (going through the `tweets.js` file).

    _**Note:** if you have lots of tweets, the process can take a while..._

6. At the end, you will see some output regarding counts and other info (but no errors).

7. After importing the tweets, we will be making some changes to the `_data/metadata.js` file, which will customize some page settings for our archive. We will modify the options as follows (leave the others without modifications):
    - `username`: your twitter handle **without the `@` symbol**
    - `homeLabel`: the label that will appear at the top of your twitter archive... it will be a link to your home page, so call it accordingly.
    - `homeURL`: URL to your home page in absolute format (for example "https://piraces.dev").

</div>
<div align="center"><em>Metadata settings and where they reflect the changes</em></div>

8. Now we are ready with our archive! Take a look at how it will be by running `npm run start` at the root folder and accessing the local URL that the process outputs to the terminal.

9. If everything looks good for you, commit and push your changes to the repostiory.

## (Optional) Set the subpath where your page will reside

You can skip this step if your twitter archive will be in the root of a domain/subdomain (such as [tweets.piraces.dev](https://tweets.piraces.dev/)), otherwise we will have to set the subpath where it will be served (for example if hosting in GitHub pages such as `piraces.github.io/tweets`).

To do this, we will need to do some changes to the `eleventy.config.js` file as follows (at the end before the closing `}`):
```js
...
    eleventyConfig.addPlugin(EleventyHtmlBasePlugin);
    return {pathPrefix: "/twitter/"}
};
```

_**Note:** change the `pathPrefix` accordingly to the path you want._

## (Optional) Configuring a subdomain to point to our GitHub Pages deployment

In this tutorial we will be using GitHub Pages to host our twitter archive, so since in my case I have the domain `piraces.dev` managed by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), I will create a subdomain called `tweets.piraces.dev` to point to the GitHub pages deployment.

To do this we will only have to create a `CNAME` DNS record with the value of the subdomain (`tweets` in this case) pointing to your GitHub domain that will be in the format `{{GITHUB_HANDLE}}.github.io` where `{{GITHUB_HANDLE}}` will be your handle/username in GitHub (`piraces.github.io` in my case).

![CNAME DNS record pointing to GitHub pages](../../img/posts/twitter-own-archive-updated/cname_record_github.png)

</div>
<div align="center"><em>CNAME DNS record pointing to GitHub pages</em></div>

The picture above shows how to set it for Cloudflare, but it will be very similar in other providers.

## Deploying our archive using GitHub pages

Once our repo has all the changes mentioned above, 

## (Optional) setting an scheduled action to update our archive




## Conclusion



**Happy deploy!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
