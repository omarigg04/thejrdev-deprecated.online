## Shortalink

**Custom link shortener service using Cloudflare Workers + KV store one of my domains (privacy first focused)**

This project is privacy friendly, nothing but the URL and necessary data for rate limit are collected, and after a time discarded (except for the URL if it is fair usage).

This API is easily consumed programmatically, such as through shell functions, making it trivial to shorten links on the fly. It is console / cURL friendly.
The browser frontend is available in GitHub Pages in [https://go.shorta.link/](https://go.shorta.link/).
